    <h3>Fiction Battles</h3>
        <div class = "project-container">
            <img src = "images/Fiction-Battles.png">
            <div class="project-description">
                <P>
                    Fiction Battles is easily my pride and joy. This was my final project for my undergrad. The idea of this project was to create a social space for people
                    to talk about their favorite characters in fiction. We designed the website using MEAN Stack because it was most well known to us. It has a lot of features.
                    You can make your own account on the website, make a list of ten of your favorite characters to be stored, you could view other user's lists, and every day 
                    we had two random character's selected for people to vote on and then they could comment on the voting going on. I was a backend developer mainly in charge 
                    of information handling. Anytime a user wanted to store or retrieve information, I developed the algorithms and functions to ensure that their data was 
                    being stored correctly and that it was being properly retrieved. This project was my most ambitious and to see everything come together in the end was 
                    awesome.

    <h3>Wordle(Ty's Version)</h3>
        <div class="project-container">
            <img src = "images/Wordle.png">
            <div class="project-description">
                <p>
                    For the final project of my C#/.NET class, I chose to make my own version of Wordle. The main reason why I chose to make a version of Wordle was because
                    right when Wordle came out, I had a lot of my friends ask me if I could make my own version of it and around the same time my teacher said we could make 
                    anything we wanted for our final project, so I thought that this was the perfect chance to try it out. I made Wordle entirely out of C# and Visual Studio 
                    and I added my own touches. I made it so you could play again without having to wait twenty-four hours and I added the ability to see the amount of right 
                    and wrong guesses. The project was a joy to work on and I was really happy with the end result.

    <h3>Jeopardy(Kinda)</h3>

                <p>
                    Jeopardy was a small little passion project of mine. I wanted to play Jeopardy with my friends after watching a lot of Youtube videos of other's doing 
                    something similar. Instead of buying it I made my own version of it. It was also built completely in C# and Visual Studio. the Version it's in right now
                    is pretty basic, but I want to plan to add more rounds and more Jeopardy features like a Daily Double.
